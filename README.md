# Blockchain Project Instructions as follows:

This blockchain project need few tools and different software components for build and execution purpose. 

# Requried Software tool as follows:

1. Etherium IDE - We have use Remix IDE and use solidity langauge to build and execute blockchain code. Its oline open source tools supports almost all browsers please follow the link. https://remix.ethereum.org/ comprise with in-build complier and deployment features.

2.  Metamask - For this project we have use metamask again an open source tools comes with an extention for any mordern browser such as Edge, Firefox, Chrome and so on. Follow link https://metamask.io/download, I have used Edge browser and works like a charm. 
    

    To setup metamask download the extensation and open directly from there itself. By default it comes with Etherum network and also offers Testing network for transactions purpoose. For this project we have use Ropsten network. 

    Note: For new verions the test network maybe disable, once can enable by moving the toggle button in setting setion.


3.  Github - We need a respository to store source code for add and alteration of project work. Link as follows: https://github.com/, if you already have an account then create a respository and clone it with your working directory. Or Create a new account and follows the mentioned process.


4. Visual Studio Code - This is again open source IDE used for this project as a editor. Download it from https://code.visualstudio.com/ it suupports almost all the platforms.




# Lets get started
Navigate https://remix.ethereum.org/ online editor using solidity language. To get familiar with solidity please follow https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/index.htm. Using remix create a new file with .sol extention and run basic code using solidity language. Remix provision with in-build compliers and deployment tool.


 1. Metamask - Lets create an account on metamask, note down passpharse for future reference as this is one time generated and need to access the metamask account. Do not share this passpharse in order to avoid accessing yur account by anonymous users. After successful account creation it will generate account if in an encrypted format one can find on top section on metamask. This ID is used for all your transactions. 

 2. Metamask with Remix - Copy paste the code writtein NCILabCoin.col on your remix, after adding code for blockchain transaction connect metamask using remix by selecting Injected Web3 option from environment dropdown under Deploy and Run Transaction window appear from left side of the remix.

    Note: For succesfull connectivity remix and metamask should running on same browser.

3. Connectivity - Once connected successfuly we may added free blockchain amount using encryted id into our account links as follows: 

    https://faucet.metamask.io/
    
    https://faucet.ropsten.be/
    https://faucet.dimensions.network/
    https://ropsten.etherscan.io

    This comes handy for our testing. Transaction history visible on https://etherscan.io/ used the account id or hash transation id.

4. Import tokens - Onces remix generates transaction it also created contract for each transaction for the same. Use the same contract id to import tokens generated by code on metamask with import token options and comtract Id to it.    


#
#  Adding blockchain code to Etherum

Navigate to latest transaction by using contract id on https://etherscan.io/ and under contract tab copy paste all the code which was written in remix and click on submit. After succesful acceptance, a new contract gets generated and use the same transaction code import tokens on metamask.
